# The Green Pantry

The Green Pantry is a premium, performance-focused website created for a healthy cloud kitchen brand.  
The goal of the project is to present the brand in a clean, minimal, and professional way while keeping the site fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.

The design prioritizes clarity, whitespace, and smooth interactions to match a wellness-focused food brand rather than a typical fast-food layout.
